# Hey, welcome! ðŸ‘‹

When I have time, I work on different projects to expand my knowledge in different programming languages such as JavaScript and C++ and also learn a greater range of topics, ranging from hardware drivers to machine learning. The opportunity presented in this subject is endless and I am willing and eager to learn new things and face new challenges!
